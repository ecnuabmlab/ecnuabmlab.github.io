I am a full professor in the Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University (ECNU). I received the Ph.D. (2011) in the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at the Shanghai Jiaotong University;  M.Eng. (2006) in the School of Engineering at Shantou University, and B.Eng. (2002) in the School of Automation at Chongqing University. Before joining ECNU, I worked as an Lecturer at Harbin Institute of Technology (2012-2017) and as a postdoc at Purdue University (2016-2017). I also visited the The Education University of Hong Kong under the support of Croucher Scholarship (2023-2024).
