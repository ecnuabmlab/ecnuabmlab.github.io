I am a full professor in the Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University (ECNU). I received the Ph.D. (2011) in the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at the Shanghai Jiaotong University;  M.Eng. (2006) in the School of Engineering at Shantou University, and B.Eng. (2002) in the School of Automation at Chongqing University. Before joining ECNU, I worked as an Lecturer at Harbin Institute of Technology (2012-2017) and as a postdoc at Purdue University (2016-2017). I also visited the The Education University of Hong Kong under the support of Croucher Scholarship (2023-2024).  

### Research Areas:   (ABM Lab)

I am passionate about creating impactful AI tools for widespread adoption, specializing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), video understanding, intelligent manufacturing, and AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD), all presented in a fun and engaging way.

### Who we are

We are a team driven by practical applications, uncovering scientific questions through hands-on practice and delving into them with a rigorous and pragmatic approach. We strive not only for theoretical innovation and breakthroughs but also for transforming research outcomes into productive forces that drive societal progress and create genuine value.  
We call ourselves "idealistic realists," believing that ideals and reality are interdependent. Ideals illuminate our path forward, while reality provides the foundation for their realization. At the intersection of the two, we uphold a grounded and pragmatic spirit, exploring the unknown while gazing at the stars and chasing future possibilities.  

Our mission is to drive global progress through technology and solve critical problems with innovation. We are committed to discovering and addressing scientific unknowns, delivering better solutions for industries, and building a more sustainable future for society. Harnessing the power of technology to illuminate humanityâ€™s potential, we aim to make the world a better place.

### News

I am actively looking for motivated PhD, MS, undergraduate students to work with us.
